# 100 Days Of ML Code - Activity Log



### Day 0: July 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Learned about hyperparameter tuning, which entails changing the parameters of a machine learning model, as opposed to making changes to the underlying data.  In this case, was looking at the k-value in a KNN model (see next line).

Worked through exercises to optimize hyperparamters, specifically in a k-nearest-neighbors model (optimizing the k-value by using grid search).

Next, learned about using holdout validation, a process involving splitting your dataset into a 50% train and 50% test set, generating predictions, calculating errors, switching the train and test set, repeating earlier steps, and then averaging your errors.

**Thoughts:** 

The hyperparameter tuning using grid search is pretty quick, easy, and efficient.  I enjoyed learning about it.  However, throughout the exercises, I had to revisit a couple concepts including looping through dictionaries and using the Python built-in function 'enumerate'.

This was my first exposure to holdout validation, which is a pretty handy concept.  I'm looking forward to learning more about this and applying to some other "price prediction" datasets.

### Day 1: July 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Learned about the modules KFold and cross_val_score, both from Python's Scikit-Learn library.  

Worked on completing the Dataquest Machine Learning Fundamentals course by spending an hour on the guided project, Predicting Car Prices.  I will post the completed project once I make it all the way through.  One thing I try to do with most of these guided projects is to create a template that can be used for other similar efforts.

I also signed up for the following Kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/discussion/62146
And.... the associated Google Cloud ML Course on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp?utm_source=googlecloud&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=kaggle_competition_email

Lastly, I worked through Day 9 of HackerRank's '30 Days of Code' challenge.  Today entailed using a simple recursive function to calculate a factorial of an integer.  Powerful technique, simple implementation in Python.  Link is provided below.  

It's going to be a lottttttt to keep up with all of these things over the next 100 days, but I couldn't be more excited to learn and grind.

**Thoughts:** 

One thing I'm consistently reminded of as I go through various exercises and guided projects is how important knowing how to clean your data is.  Data is inherently "unclean" from an analytics perspective, and it takes significant effort to get your dataframe into a format where you COULD apply a machine learning algorithm to it.  I imagine it's a topic I'm going to have to come back to again and again.

### Day 2: July 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

Worked through HackerRank's Day 10 Challenge, counting the maximum number of 1's in a binary representation of some int.  This was a good little challenge, and I took the longer route to ensure I understood every step.  You can see the link to my work below.

I also completed Dataquest's Machine Learning Fundamentals course including a project to predict car prices.  Link to this is also below.

I will wrap up the day by working through some more of Google Cloud's ML Course.

**Thoughts:** 

One of the first things I did today was decided to make a change to my approach in terms of studying.  Although I'm generally putting between 3-4 hours a day, I want to be sure I'm hitting certain things daily.  As such, I'm going to always start my day with a single HackerRank challenge.  That will ensure I always have something that I can share and that I'm getting the coding synapses firing.  After HackerRank, I'll ensure I get at least 1% of my Dataquest Data Scientist Path completed.  Lastly, I'll spend the rest of my time doing the Google Cloud Machine Learning Course and Kaggle Taxi Fare Prediction Competition.

### Day 3: August 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Started the day working through HackerRanks "30 Days of Code" Day 11 challenge on 2D Arrays.  More specifically, the task was to take a 6 x 6 2D array, and find the largest sum of all hourglass shapes.  This was great practice for much of the HackerRank challenges leading up to it, reinforcing the concepts of referencing by index, loops, and finding maximum values.  You can see the link to my solution below.

Next, I dug into Dataquest's Calculus for Machine Learning course, which begins with a discussion of "rate of change" and the concept of a secant line (which I imagine will soon translate to a discussion on tangents and derivatives).

I might get a small amount more than this done today, but will call it a little earlier than usual.  I still got around 2 hours of studying in, which I feel okay about.

**Thoughts:** 
Reflecting on the last few months, and also understanding how I'm approaching things going forward, I can't help but feel extremely optimistic that I've been making good progress and will be making great progress going forward.  It's been a lot of fun to feel certain synapses in my brain fire in new ways and for algorithmic thinking to start seeming more natural.  

In the world of Computer Science, and the exploding disciplines of Data Science and Machine Learning, one of the biggest appeals to me is that you can never master it.  To be fair, you can get really good.  But, just as you're getting really good, technology is still evolving.  New paradigms are coming into existence, new software and hardware stacks, new languages.  It is now and has been evident to me for some time that I never want to stop this journey.  

I'm loving every minute!

### Day 4: August 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Started out with Day 12 of HackerRank's "30 Days of Code" challenge, which dealt with class and inheritance.  This is one of those topics, that when you're getting started, seems pretty abstract and can be a little bit challenging to grasp.  However, the power of class inheritance in object-oriented programming cannot be overstated.  Having classes and sub-classes saves you tons of time writing the same functions, methods and the like over and over.  Link to my solution is below.

I'm getting my progress tracking out of the way now, but I do expect to spend another hour working on Dataquest's Linear Algebra for Machine Learning course.  

**Thoughts:** 
Yesterday was a bit of a challenge from a motivational standpoint.  I got through quite a bit of material, but felt like I was having to "bite down on the mouth guard" (to borrow a sports saying) to keep going.  It's important for me to remember that it's okay to have those days, and to have days where I meet my minimal commitment of one hour.  Burnout is a real thing when you're pouring everything you have into something.  I've dealth with it in sports, in academia, and just about every other facet of life.  It's natural, and it passes.  As such, today I'm going to wrap things up at a reasonable time, spend time with my wife, and allow my brain a chance to digest much of the material I've poured into it over the last week or so.

### Day 5: August 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I kicked things off with HackerRank's Day 12 of the 30 Days of Code.  The challenge today had to do with Abstract Classes, which involves creating a class, that cannot be instantiated, but whose properties and methods are then extended to a subslcass, which can be instantiated (say, what?!)  See thoughts below in "Thoughts" section.

Next, I continued working on Dataquest's Linear Algebra for Machine Learning course.  Specifically, worked on getting matrices into row reduced echelon form (1's along diagonal from top left to bottom right and 0's elsewhere), using Gaussian Elimination (leveraging row operations to get matrix into desired form).

I also plan to get some of the Coursera/Google Cloud ML course in over the course of the day.

I'm at 2.5 hours of study so far today, which is a good way to start my morning, and kick off my work day.

**Thoughts:** 
Continuing on with my "say, what?!" comment above, this was a pretty straight-forward challenge for an all-things-not-straight-forward concept.  I had to do quite a bit of reading about the purpose for using an Abstract Base Class (ABC) in Python, and came to this conclusion: the primary goal is to ensure what can be considered certain "standards" on the subclasses.  For example, all attributes and methods must be defined in the subclass.  This can help you avoid overlooking certain things you need your subclass to do.  Really interesting and seemingly valuable concept, primarily when you are coding at scale (many subclasses per ABC).  However, am I missing anything here?  Would love to hear a "layman's terms" explanation of this concept.

With regards to the linear algegbra, I didn't realize how much of this content has slipped my mind over the years since my Mathematical Economics courses.  Revisiting this material really reinforces that how I'm approaching my learning, by going through specializations/tracks, is a great way to do it.  Reason being, even if you have to revisit topics you already "know," this really helps solidify them and serves as a great refresher.

### Day 6: August 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Got Day 6 of the 100 Days of ML Challenge started with HackerRank's "30 Days of Code" Day 14 Scope challenge.  This challenge involved creating a class method that references instance variables, and computing the maximum difference between any 2 integers in a list.  See "Link to work" below for solution.

Next, dove back into Dataquest's 'Linear Algebra for Machine Learning' course.  Worked with matrix-vector operations, specifically using the numpy.dot method to multiply matrices by vectors.  Finished the day solving systems of equations by using matrix inversion (see "Link to work" below).  If you're familiar with solving systems of equations using this method, you know it's enough to make you want to close your computer and leave the house... (just kidding, sort of)

So, being a nice day here in Denver, that's what I'm going to do.  Cheers everyone.

I'll be back at it tomorrow with a fresh mind and energy.

**Thoughts:** 
Object-oriented programming is a very powerful thing, and can feel a bit overwhelming at times.  Class inheritance, instance and class methods, super(), metaclass... the terms alone are enough to make your head spin.  However, there is one thing that makes me feel better about my ability to thoroughly grasp these concepts over time, and that is, I am leaps and bounds beyond where I was when I started programming, and even from a couple months back.

A saying that I often think of during the more grueling days is from the one and only Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.  He says, “Success isn’t always about ‘Greatness’, it’s about consistency. Consistent, hard work gains success. Greatness will come.”  I've noticed with anything you are trying to learn and get better at in life, the way you do that is BY SHOWING UP AND BEING ENGAGED.  Even on an off day, you can still watch a video or read an article having to do with whatever it is your trying to learn.

I've mentioned before, that it's been fun to notice certain concepts which once I couldn't grasp become much more palatable over time, and even to where I feel I could explain them to someone else.  The journey is long from over, but it's already been really gratifiying.

### Day 7: August 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
For Day 7 of the 100 Days of ML Challenge, I worked on a HackerRank challenge for Linked Lists.  My task was to create an insert method to take a first node (header), create the subsequent nodes, and return a reference to the header. (see "Link to work" below)

Spent a little over an hour working on the problem and reading documntation on how Linked Lists work, and how they are implemented in Python.  

I might cap the day off with some of the Google ML course on Coursera, but that's up in the air at this point.

**Thoughts:** 
At a high level, the concept of a linked list is not a particularly difficult thing to grasp.  Here's the gist... you have a header node, which starts with data and a pointer to any subsequent/ linked nodes.  As each node is added, it similarly has data and pointers to the next nodes.  The last node has data, and null/'None' as a pointer. 

Despite being able to grasp the concept well, I definitely feel like I need to keep reading up on implementation steps and try to find some walkthroughs, so that I thoroughly understand all of the code.

### Day 8: August 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Kicked of Day 8 of the 100 Days of ML Challenge with more HackerRank.  Specifically, today I was working with exception handling.  The goal was to take a string input provided by HackerRank, convert the string to an integer, and print the converted value.  However, in a case where the value could not be converted, I printed "Bad String."

Next, I spent some time on Dataquest's "Linear Algebra for Machine Learning" course.  Numpy's Linear Algebra (linalg) module was introduced, which makes things like calculating the determinant and inverse of a matrix MUCH quicker and easier than doing it by hand.

I'll cap the day off with a little bit more Dataquest or Coursera's Google ML course.

**Thoughts:** 
Even as a more novice programmer, this was probably the easiest HackerRank challenge I've come across up to this point.  It was pretty refreshing after staring at linked lists and variable scope for the last couple days.

It's great revisiting concepts related to Linear Algebra.  I've always enjoyed learning about mathematical topics, particularly Calculus and Linear Algebra.  I prefer a good optimization problem over a Sudoku or other puzzle most days.

### Day 9: August 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
As has been the case for recent posts, got Day 9 of the 100 Days of ML Code Challenge started with HackerRank.  Today, extended the concept of Exception handling by throwing a custom error message when the parameters to a method do not meet certain criteria (being positive in this case).  

Next, I finished Dataquest's "Linear Algebra for Machine Learning" course.  The end of the course talked about systems that have trivial solutions (zero vector), infinitely many solutions (linearly dependent equations) and no solutions.  The process for solving systems differs whether the matrix is rectangular (must use Gaussian elimination) or square (can use determinant and matrix inversion).  

Link to Certificate: https://www.dataquest.io/view_cert/K7SKI4D947299HQAQ0I3/

Next up was the start of the Linear Regression for Machine Learning course in Dataquest.  Having an Economics background, a lot of this is familiar territory to me.  The course starts with an intro to creating a Linear Regression in Python, and the goal of minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares.

Finishing the day, as usual, with the Google Cloud / Coursera ML course.

**Thoughts:** 
The concept of creating classes and class inheritance is an integral piece of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). And for those of us who don't have a CS background, and haven't had the pleasure of a professor beating this into our heads for months on end, it's a bit tricky to understand. It's a concept that I've gone back to time and time again, asking questions like, "What is this 'init' thing again? Why am I putting self in this class method? Wait, why am I torturing myself with this again?" (kidding on the last part).

I re-read an article I had seen some time ago again today, from the following link: https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/

The author gives a great breakdown of the intersection between Python as a language and OOP. Give it a read, if you're like me, and still working to solidify those concepts.

### Day 10: August 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Once again, got Day 10 of the 100 Days of ML Code Challenge started with HackerRank.  Today, I  dug into Queues and Stacks, which are data structures.  One of the biggest differentiators between the two is that a stack's elements can only be manipulated by Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and a queue's elements are manipulated by First-In-First-Out (FIFO).

I did some extra reading to ensure I understood these concepts, and found this really useful article: https://medium.com/@kojinoshiba/data-structures-in-python-series-2-stacks-queues-8e2a1703d67b

The following Python documentation I also found really useful: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html

I spent a couple hours on the above this morning, working to wrap my head around how these data structures work and their implementation in Python.

I'm also going to continue on with Dataquest's Linear Regression for Machine Learning course and the Google Cloud ML course on Coursera.

**Thoughts:** 
One thing I've been extremely thankful for is diving into these HackerRank challenges every morning.  Having been trained as an Economist, there are a number of Machine Learning concepts that come pretty naturally/ easily (optimization, minimizing errors, calculus, statistics, linear algebra, etc.).  However, something that most of us from Statistics and Economics backgrounds lack is the formal Data Structures and Algorithms training.  I feel I'm growing a lot by forcing myself to think through these things on a daily basis.  It's not a practice I plan on stopping.  Coupling this with the Data Science education I'm getting online seems to be a really good recipe for success.  Of course, there is a long way to go, but I'm feeling optimistic about all of it.

### Day 11: August 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Day 11 of the 100 Days of Machine Learning Code Challenge started with more... you guessed it... HackerRank.  Today's challenge had to do with Interfaces.  An interface, in practice, is very similar to an Abstract Class (set of rules, specs, methods for related Classes to use).  However, after doing some digging, I realized that Interfaces are not really "a thing" in Python.  Python has the benefit of allowing multiple inheritance, which I understand is the primary use for Interfaces in say, Java.  As such, my solution really just involved implementing a class method "Calculator" (which was an instance of another class "Advanced Arithmetic").  Check out the link to the solution below in the "Link to work."

It's probably also worth noting that for the last couple nights, I've been working through Coursera's Google ML course, which has been pretty awesome.  Learning about how such an incredible company with so much influence approaches Machine Learning is really beneficial.  I've seen course sections devoted to Machine Learning workflow, model bias (which surprisingly was being taught by my college roommate... REALLY COOL!), and last night, got to look at Qwiklabs, which is an IDE for analytics in Google Cloud.

**Thoughts:** 
Short on thoughts today, but ultimately, I'll just say that this challenge has been extremely fun and gratifying.  Getting to interact with the Data Science and Machine Learning communities, learning that there are so many other people out there who aim to change themselves in order to help change the world, I feel extremely thankful.  I can't wait to see how my skill set and network of similar-minded people evolves over the next 90 days.  Thank you to everybody who are out there, learning, contributing, and helping each other get better!

### Day 12: August 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Day 12's HackerRank challenge of the day had to do with bubble sort, a sorting algorithm that takes each item in an array, and if the next item is bigger, swaps the two.  The result is that each item "bubbles" to it's respective place in the array.  After each item is iterated through in this way, you have a sorted array.

If you haven't seen it, check out this video of Eric Schmidt of Google asking Obama about which algorithm to use for a specific sorting problem (hint: it's not bubble sort):

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bubble+sort+obama

I'm also going to work on more of the Linear Regression for Machine Learning course in Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** 
A topic that's come up quite a bit recently in posts, and in conversations with the Data Science community on LinkdeIn, is whether the focal point for the budding data scientist should be learning or doing.  That is, should you be focused on the knowledge acquisition or working on projects and building things. 

This is something I think a lot about, and I know many of us struggle with where the balance should be.

Here is how I'm approaching things....

Currently, I'm focusing 90% on knowledge and 10% on projects.  I plan to continue this until I'm through all of the Dataquest material.  Reason being, I want to have a good foundational knowledge on which to lean.  Then, as I'm going through a project, I'm spending less time scratching my head, and more time referring back to things I've learned (or leveraging Stack Overflow and actually knowing what to ask).

Once I finish Dataquest, I plan to switch gears and be closer to 50% knowledge and 50% projects.  More specifically, I will try to apply everything I'm learning to working with a dataset that I'm interested in and hopefully coming up with an ML "solution" to a problem.

Over time, as I reach a good level of knowledge saturation, most of my efforts will be directed at projects, and I'll take courses primarily as refreshers or to learn things I haven't been exposed to.

### Day 13: August 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Kicked today off on HackerRank learning about Generics.  Generics are a way that you can parameterize your datatypes in some programming languages, although it isn't particularly applicable to Python.  Reason being, Python is dynamically typed rather than statically typed.  In a statically typed language, you have to define the datatype of a variable.  Python determines the datatype for you by looking at the data with a paradigm called "duck typing," named based on the phrase "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."  In order to get through to the next challenge, I looked at some of the Java solutions in the discussions and submitted one.

Because I didn't get to work through a coding exercise on the above, I jumped into the next HackerRank challenge on Binary Search Trees (BST).  In a BST, the element in each left subtree is smaller than it's parent node, and the element in the right subtree is larger than the parent node.  You can see the tutorial here (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-search-trees/tutorial) for a better understanding.  This is a really handy search algorithm that has wide-ranging applications, and is valuable as an efficient way to find out whether items are related, and the distance between them.

I also spent some more time on Dataquest's Linear Regression for Machine Learning course, which I will hopefully be able to wrap up tomorrow.  The focus in this course today was on determining the appropriate features to include in your model, by understanding the correlation between the features and target variable, and across the features themselves.

**Thoughts:** 
Both of the HackerRank challenges above were really tough, and I did have to do some scouring of the discussions and StackOverflow to get an understanding of some of the ways to implement them.  Although it's frustrating to not grasp these concepts right off the bat sometimes, I acknowledge that self-teaching data structures and algorithms is challenging in and of itself.  If I keep at it, like anything else, these concepts will become more manageable over time.

### Day 14: August 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on HackerRank's Day 23 (of 30 Days of Code challenge), involving Level-Order traversal.  Level-order traversal is where you start at the root of a binary tree, and traverse the tree by going to each of the child subtrees sequentially, from left to right (you visit each level of the tree in order).

I also worked some on the Linear Regression for Machine Learning course in Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** 
Today was one of the first days that I legitimately could not figure out a solution to this problem.  Even on days where I've looked around at different approaches, I always want to make sure that I could get to the solution I'm leveraging in creating my own.  Today, unfortunately, was not one of those days.  As such, I'm not posting a solution until I can fully understand how it works.  

I definitely feel like the last few days of the HackerRank challenges have tested my resilience and been a bit discouraging.  However, this is where the biggest gains come from.  The moment you have to tap into your grittiness to break through a perceived plateau is a great thing.  

I'm going to keep reading through documentation on Queues, Binary Trees, and Level-Order Traversal until I understand these concepts.  I'm also going to try and leverage the community on LinkdeIn to see if I can find some good resources to help get over this hump.

**Link to work:** 
None today, unfortunately.



### Day 15: August 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today I spent around an hour and a half looking at different resources on Binary Trees and Traversal methodologies.  All in all, I kept it light and am giving myself an opportunity to rest and re-energize.

**Thoughts:** 
Over the coming couple days, I'll spend a little bit of time each day learning more about Data Structures and trying to get over the hump of where I'm currently stuck.  However, I'll focus more on the Data Science oriented learning, rather Computer Science.  Hopefully, giving my brain a chance to internalize the Data Structure material will help me connect with it in a way that I haven't been able to up to this point.  

A lot of the above was advice from the Data Science community on LinkedIn, who have been awesome to get to know and are always supportive.  Thanks to all of those who offered said support.

### Day 16: August 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today I did a little bit more work on the Coursera/ Google Cloud ML course, and spent some time learning about algorithms via Mike Bostock's post "Visualizing Algorithms."  Keeping this week a little bit lighter than normal, but acquiring knowledge either way.

**Thoughts:** 
It was really nice to take a bit of a break over the last couple days.  At times, it's easy to burn out and to forget that what we are doing in trying to learn new material can be hard.  And that's okay.  It's all about the perseverance to keep going, the humility to leverage resources in the community, and the curiosity that keeps you happy on the journey.  Sometimes it's probably useful to break things up, to seek out new answers in the greater journey toward learning Data Science.  And in the end, those things that feel like a struggle will likely present themselves in a more digestible manner.

**Link to work:** 
None, but definitely check out the following link, which is pretty helpful in understanding algorithms: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/



### Day 17: August 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Day 17 of the 100 Days of ML Code Challenge involved some more learning in Coursera's Google Cloud ML course.  Overall, some really intriguing and fun material.  The course demonstrated how you can use a high-powered virtual machine to do some of the heavy lifting for you, and then you can take a somewhat aggregated dataset and work with it in a hosted notebook environment (with a look and feel of Jupyter).  I worked through this workflow in a couple different labs, including one on hosting Earthquake data and another on analyzing flight delays.

**Thoughts:** 
It's interesting to see how advanced and/or modern technologies can make seemingly arduous tasks relatively simple.  Being exposed to the Google Cloud environment seems to be indicative of a soon-to-be world where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions are not only ubiquitous in their accessibility, but are relatively easy to implement without formal training in these types of technologies.  It was a reminder of how much I enjoy this stuff, and that I don't "always" need to bog myself down in minutia.

### Day 18: August 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I spent hours and hours and hours digging back into Binary Trees, reading different articles to understand their construction, how to print them, how to traverse them, and why the heck I was stuck.  When I realized that my major sticking point was certain recursive functions, that's where I went next.

Below are a couple links I was digging into:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tree_traversal_algorithms.htm

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_binary_tree.html

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM-oswPn19o

**Thoughts:** 
As mentioned above, today I realized why I've struggled with a lot of the concepts around Binary Trees, and a lot of it has to do with them being a recursive structure.  Being from a non-Computer Science background, recursion can be a tricky concept to fully internalize.  Of course, there are cases where it's not particularly difficult, such as a factorial, summation, or even FizzBuzz, but when you're talking about traversing tree structures, where there are multiple recursive steps, I haven't quite had the "ah hah" moment.  I've taken in a lot of this information this week, and I think for the next few days I'll focus back on the Data Science material (Dataquest and Coursera/Google ML) and give that part of my brain a quick break.  Sunday or Monday I can get back into the weeds and try to dig myself out.

**Link to work:** 
None



### Day 19: August 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I dug back into Dataquest's Data Science path, continuing the "Linear Regresssion for Machine Learning" course (see 'Link to work' below), diving into Gradient Descent and Ordinary Least Squares estimation.  This evening I'll get a bit more done in this course, with the hopes of finishing all except the Guided Project, which I'll tackle this weekend.

To ensure I understood Gradient Descent, I read a couple articles to solidify the concepts:
https://towardsdatascience.com/gradient-descent-simply-explained-1d2baa65c757
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/10/gradient-descent-with-python/

**Thoughts:** 
Here we are, about 1/5th of the way through the 100 Days of ML Code Challenge.  One thing that's been great about the journey so far is that I've learned a lot about myself, my limitations, and generally have become a better programmer.  My hope is that toward the end of this challenge, I can really switch gears and start focusing more on project-related work, and build some cool stuff.  It's been extremely fun, challenging and really tested my persistence.  I'll finish the challenge better for it!

### Day 20: August 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I started out with Coursera/ Google's "How Google Does Machine Learning" course and completed that course. Here is the link to my certificate:
https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/E79A49DSA8MX

Then, I dove into the next course in the specialization, called "Launching into Machine Learning." I plan to spend another hour this evening working on this course, which is really interesting, and presented in a digestible way.

I also played a little bit with Binary Tree Traversal Algorithms on a whiteboard for practice purposes.

**Thoughts:** 
Interestingly, although I've left the material on Binary Search Trees "somewhat alone" over the last few days, I've still found myself understanding them more and more with each passing day.  Yesterday, I bought a whiteboard so that I could practice writing out algorithms in an interview-esque setting.  Having heard advice from my fellow Data-Science folks on LinkdeIn about the Feynman technique (thanks Sanwal), I started thinking about these algorithms as if I had to teach them to someone else.  This has helped me immensely in understanding where I'm stuck and where my focus needs to be.  In case you're wondering, the slight sticking point right now is having a multiple recursive case algorithm where once the base case is satisfied, the output/return is feeding going back to the prior step (i.e. making it's way back up the tree).  In any event, I'm confident that the clicking moment is somewhere close, even if it feels just barely out of reach at the moment.

**Link to work:** 
None (but see link to certification above)



### Day 21: August 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I continued with Coursera/ Google's "Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization", specifically moving into the course "Launching into Machine Learning." Topics of the day included the history on a number of popular Machine Learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, linear regression, perceptrons and neural networks.  Also, I looked at loss functions and gradient descent, as an alternative to Ordinary Least Squares when the data is too big (which would be computationally expensive).

**Thoughts:** 
I feel like I really got an opportunity today to solidify some concepts and have fun.  It's not always the case that these days of studying and learning are particularly enjoyable, so one thing I need to keep in mind is to seek balance (as in all things).  In other words, if I'm feeling really bogged down on a particular topic, I can leave that thing alone and dive into something else.  It's almost always easier to come back to something with a fresh mind rather than just trying to "stick it out" with a frustrated mind. The body of knowledge in this field is endless, so there's no use in sitting with a topic that isn't resonating with you at that moment.  

**Link to work:** 
None



### Day 22: August 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I continued on with Dataquest's course on "Linear Regression for Machine Learning."  I got through all of the learning material for the course.  Today's topics primarily included Ordinary Least Squares (as a way to minimize the loss function), Gradient Descent (when data is too big for OLS to be computationally feasible) and Processing and Transforming Features.  The Guided Project coming up is on "Predicting House Sale Prices," and I plan to dive into that this evening for a couple hours, making as much progress as I can.

**Thoughts:** 
I'm excited for this Guided Project and to work this Machine Learning solution from start to finish.  I've done quite a few Linear Regression analyses in R, but not thoroughly in Python.  All of the material at this point in the course is a lot of fun to work with, so I am able to approach each day with a strong sense of motivation and fulfillment.

**Link to work:** 
None, but will include Guided Project once that is complete.



### Day 23 and 24: August 21st and 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
I was unable to get my post up yesterday as I went to meet some friends in the early evening, but I did get a few hours of studying done!  Specifically, I finished up the "Linear Regression for Machine Learning" course on Dataquest.  Below is the link to my course certificate:

https://www.dataquest.io/view_cert/87RUBZAQ0204KLVGT9JU/

For the end of the course, I worked through a project using Linear Regression to predict house sale prices (see 'Link to work' below).

Today, I'm starting Dataquest's "Machine Learning in Python: Intermediate" course.  It kicked off with Logistic Regression, another very commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems (0 or 1, True or False, Yes or No... you get the picture).  

**Thoughts:** 
Having taken a little break from the HackerRank challenges, it's been reinvigorating to enjoy focusing on Machine Learning and prediction problems.  However, I plan in the next couple days to get back to my algorithm and data structure training as well, which are so helpful for developing those problem-solving synapses in the brain.  Regardless, I'm learning so much and making this commitment to learning has helped immensely.  The journey continues, and things will only become more and more clear with more practice and iteration.

### Day 25: August 23rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Day 25, a quarter of the way through the challenge!  Got the day started with some HackerRank.  Because I was having a little bit of a hard time with the Binary Search Tree(BST) Level-Order Traversal, I decided to go back to some basic tutorials and keep building on my knowledge.  After all, a complex algorithm is usually just a collection of more simple principles.  That said, I started with the first Algorithm Challenge, which was to have a function return the sum of an array... Hint: return sum(array).  Then, I signed up for HackerRank's 10 Days of Statistics Challenge and completed Day 1: Mean, Median and Mode.  I did get a little bit stuck on one of the hidden test cases, so I submitted my code to the discussion boards to try and figure out what I am doing wrong.  Having taken a shortcut and using Pandas to look for the correct answer, I believe the issue is actually the stored solution in HackerRank, and not something I'm doing wrong.  I also got into a second part of the 10 Days of Statistics Challenges, calculating weighted means.  This was a bit easier than the first challenge.  Links to both are below in 'Link to Work" section.

Next, I'm diving back into Dataquest's "Machine Learning in Python: Intermediate" course.  I will try to make some good headway on this course today, where we are looking at how you can determine accuracy of a Logistic Regression model.

**Thoughts:** 
Today has been good from a learning standpoint so far, and has highlighted something that I think is important for me to remember when I'm on a lifelong learning journey (starting with these 100 days, plus... all the work I've done up to this point).  That is, it's okay when you're learning and practicing to go back to those things that you might already be good at.  As you revert to topics that resonate more strongly with you, you are strengthening the core skills you will need to tackle more advanced topics.  It can be challenging at times to break through certain barriers, especially when you're standing at that proverbial brick wall and trying to knock it over without momentum.  But, you can take a step back, train your mind, create some momentum, and hit that wall with a renewed sense of force.  If nothing else, letting yourself enjoy the process will keep you motivated.

### Day 26: August 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
I started Day 26 off with "Day 1" of HackerRank's "10 Days of Statistics" Challenge.  The challenge involved finding the quartiles of an array of integers (without using Numpy or other Python packages).  It was a pretty good challenge that was helpful in reinforcing the modulus and floor division operators, which you see come up again and again in computer science.  See link to my solution below in the "Link to Work" section.

Next, I'll be diving back into Dataquest's "Machine Learning in Python: Intermediate" course.

**Thoughts:** 
Short on thoughts today, but I'm going to keep on grinding through and hoping to have a good, productive weekend.  I would love nothing more than to get 6-8 hours of coursework in this weekend.  As I wind these courses down, I'm very much looking forward to getting back into some projects!

### Day 27: August 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I switched gears quite a bit and spent most of the day (around 5 hours) working with A/B Testing on a Udacity course at the following link: https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257.  I plan to finish up the course tomorrow, perform a thorough review, and complete a project (two would be even better).

**Thoughts:** 
Marketing analytics is everywhere!  If you look at some of the most common analytics jobs that are posted, they often involve using Analytics and Machine Learning to support marketing teams.  Furthermore, in that domain, there are a few skills that pop up continuously to be successful in that type of role.   They include A/B Testing, working with survey data, and having a firm grasp of inferential statistics in order to deliver insights.  One thing I've realized is that I don't get the opportunity to work with this type of data very often in my professional environment, so I really want to continue trying to round out my skill set and develop this area.  It's evident to me that the most successful Data Scientists continuously look to expand their knowledge and apply what they know to new domains.  I plan to be no different.

**Link to Work:**

### Day 28: August 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Here we are, Day 28, which continued with lots and lots more of the Udacity course on A/B Testing at the following link:

https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257

This was a very thorough course, covering a lot of useful content.  Seeing as how I haven't had to dig into a z-score table in a little while, I'll consider that a win (being slightly sarcastic)!  In reality, the course is great.  It talked about all of the steps you would go through to conduct an A/B test and many considerations including your sample size, ethics, and when it would make sense to make a business recommendation based on your results.  After all, if you're 99% confident the change is statistically significant, but it won't have a tangible (of acceptable magnitude) impact to the business, is it really worth it?!

The plan was to be able to put together a project today, but I fear it may have to wait until tomorrow, as I've probably spent a total of 10 hours or so this weekend going through this material, and I could use a little relaxation and time spent with my wife!

**Thoughts:** 
Made a lot of progress today, and this was my first prolonged exposure to Udacity curriculum.  I have to say, the delivery was really good, practical, and easy to follow.  If I had to guess, their AB testing is on point!  I look forward tomorrow to digging in to this a little bit more, creating some guidelines about A/B Testing that I can refer back to, and working through the project (hopefully in generalized form that I can continue to use and refine for future projects).

### Day 29: August 27th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Alright, alright... what a whirlwind the last few days has been.  Because I really wanted to get through Udacity's course on A/B Testing, my hour a day of studying commitment turned into around 6 hours on average.  It was an absolute grind, but gratifying nonetheless. 
The ultimate "deliverable" as a result of my 18 hours of study is a thorough article I wrote on A/B testing, as well as a working example in Python (Udacity's final project from the course).  
Please check both out here:
https://dananomics.com/ab-testing/

**Thoughts:** 
I really had to test my resolve to get through all of this content the last few days, but it feels great to have accomplished what I did.  One of the things I found the most intriguing about studying A/B Testing is how applicable and versatile it is in optimizing a product.  Whether you have a website, or a restaurant, or any other "thing" that people consume, A/B Testing is a great way to iterate and move it in a positive direction.  For all of those who are passionate about finding a career or connecting on LinkedIn, you could definitely do it there as well by experimenting with different content or layouts.  Although you may not be able to conduct a true "split test," on your social media profiles, you can still do meaningful test for practical and statistical significance of a metric after a change.  The experimentation on your profile you're doing in order to pursue that new career, might just be the demonstrable experience you need to... well... get you that new career.

### Day 30: August 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
After the last few days of grinding, I'm going to give myself a little bit of a rest today and just doing some Python language refreshing and solidifying by working on HackerRank's Python Language Proficiency.  

Here is a list of the problems I got through:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-loops/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
4. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/write-a-function/problem - On this challenge, I continued to try and use floor division rather than the modulo operator for quite a few minutes, which was a lot of fun (just kidding, it was not).
5. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-print/problem - Picked up a little something new using the end parameter in the print function (which allows you to change from the default newline to something different, such as a space, comma, etc.)
6. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/decorators-2-name-directory/problem

**Thoughts:** 
After putting together my thorough write-up and project on A/B Testing, today I hit the highest number of website views and visitors that I have up to this point.  This reinforces a certain message I see popping up again and again on social media... that is, you get out what you put in.  It's a great feeling to know that people are looking at (and hopefully benefiting from) something you created.   

**Link to Work:** 
Links to challenges are above, but most were simple enough to not warrant creating and saving a script for them.



### Day 31: August 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I kicked things off with my morning routine of HackerRank challenges. One had to do with if-else statements in Python, and the second built on an earlier quartile challenge to find the interquartile range. These two challenges are listed below:

1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-if-else/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-interquartile-range/problem

Next, I dug back into the Dataquest Machine Learning material, starting with "Multiclass Classification."

**Thoughts:** 
Not a whole lot in terms of thoughts today, back to the routine of learning and growing.  The plate is getting a little bit overloaded with different content and material I'm learning, so it's time to clear some of that up.

**Link to Work:** 
1. https://github.com/danahagist/100_Days_Of_ML_Code/blob/master/day31_ifElse.py
2. https://github.com/danahagist/100_Days_Of_ML_Code/blob/master/day31_interquartileRange.py



### Day 32: August 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, for my HackerRank practice, I started working through some of the SQL challenges.
Here are a list of the challenges I completed:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-the-select-query/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-the-select-query-2/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-all-sql/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
4. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-by-id/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
5. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/japanese-cities-attributes/problem
6. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/japanese-cities-name/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
7. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-1/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
8. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-3/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen - This was a cool challenge as I got to work with the modulus operator in Oracle SQL for the first time
9. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-4/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
10. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem - I had a long, crazy solution to this problem, and then realized that two of my sub-queries were the answer, so I deleted the other half page of query.

**Thoughts:** 
Always nice to work with a technology that you see on a daily basis and sharpen those skills a little bit.  Today I worked through quite a few challenges that made me think outside the box and definitely challenged me a bit.  Just like any other day, I'm simply going to keep going, keep learning and keep growing.  For the next couple weeks, I'll likely continue sharpening my skills around SQL as well as quantitative analysis and statistics; also would really would love to finish up Dataquest!

### Day 33: August 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, for my HackerRank practice, I continued working through more of the SQL challenges.

Here are a list of the HackerRank challenges I completed:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-6/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-7/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-8/problem

I also read the following documentation in order to refresh on regular expressions in SQL:
1. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/appdev.101/b10795/adfns_re.htm
2. https://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/regexp_like.php
3. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b10759/conditions018.htm#SQLRF00501

**Thoughts:** 
Something that today is highlighting for me, is how helpful this daily practice is for highlighting things that need to be refreshed. An example is that I was working on the first SQL exercise today, where I used a somewhat "brute force" solution to the problem (pretty simple this way), but there is a much more elegant solution in using regular expressions (regex).  However, I very rarely come across using regex functions, so this highlighted for me the need to dig back into this topic, both in SQL and likely in Python as well.  

**Link to Work:** 
None



### Day 34: September 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I dug back into the HackerRank challenges with some SQL practice.  

Here are a list of the HackerRank challenges I completed:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-pads/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-the-count-function/problem
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-sum/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
4. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-the-average-function/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
5. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/average-population/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen - When converting a number to an integer (not rounding, but keeping only the integer part), can use the FLOOR or CAST(number AS INT)

I read the following documentation in order to refresh on the CONCAT operator in Oracle SQL (I had forgotten that it only took up to 2 arguments, so any more and you have to nest your CONCATs):
1. https://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/functions/concat.php

**Thoughts:** 
Well, hello September!  It's hard to imagine that Fall is upon us, and I'm a third of the way through this challenge.  Keeping things a little bit light today, as it's time to give myself a bit of a break, enjoy being home in California with friends, and do some wine tasting.  Expecting to get back to the heavy study this week, and get some progress on the Dataquest material.

### Day 35: September 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Had to miss a day yesterday, as I was at home with friends and family, and didn't have the opportunity to get my laptop opened (which is probably a great thing).  Today, I started as I usually do, with some HackerRank work in SQL.  I'm also looking at some "Cracking the Coding Interview" type of questions to keep those fresh as well.

Here are a list of the HackerRank challenges I completed:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/earnings-of-employees/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-2/problem
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-13/problem

I read the following documentation in order to refresh on the TRUNC operator:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions200.htm

**Thoughts:** 
Squeezing this in on a train from Sacramento to Oakland today.  Not always easy to make time for these commitments, but similarly gratifying to the overall learning experience of the 100 Days of ML Code challenge is the part about challenging yourself internally, exercising grittiness, and doing my best to show up each day.  Although yesterday it wasn't feasible to break away for an hour, it's good to get some in today.

### Day 36: September 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
For Day 36, I kicked things off with the course on "Multiclass Classification" with Dataquest, and made it through to the course on "Overfitting."

Also, read a couple pieces of documentation on Python (Pandas) methods including:
1. http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.idxmax.html
2. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html

**Thoughts:** 
Seeing as how I'm still on vacation, I'm posting now to enjoy my time at home with friends for the rest of the day.  Will pick up more material tomorrow, time permitting.

**Link to Work:** 
None



### Day 37: September 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today, I kicked things off with a little bit of HackerRank SQL work, including the following challenge:
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem

**Thoughts:** 
Another light day today, as I went into the city of San Francisco for some quality time with my wife and some good food!

**Link to Work:** 
None



### Day 38: September 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Continued on today with more SQL HackerRank challenges, and getting into some of the more challenging ones (see #4, which I'm still working through).
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/asian-population/problem
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/african-cities/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/average-population-of-each-continent/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen
4. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/occupations/problem

I also read documentation on the following functions:
1. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions137.htm
2. https://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/pivot.php

**Thoughts:** 
Definitely learning more as I dive into some of these challenges that are really meant to test you.  I haven't worked as much with the Pivot and Row_Number functions, so I spent some time brushing up on those.

### Day 39: September 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Started today working with and really trying to understand the working pieces of the following HackerRank challenge:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/occupations/problem

I've included a link to my work below with comments explaining how it works.

Also worked on the following challenge:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-standard-deviation/problem

**Thoughts:** 
Still on vacation until this Sunday, so knocked out my hour this morning, and will enjoy the day in my hometown of Santa Cruz, CA.

### Day 40: September 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Had to take a couple days away while I was spending time with friends and family, but back on it today and going to get some good studying and production done.  I started things off with 2 Lessons from Udacity's "Intro to Statistics" course, at the following link:
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

Then, I worked on some of the HackerRank "10 Days of Statistics" challenges, including finishing the following (Day 2):
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/tutorial
2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-2/problem
3. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-3/problem


**Thoughts:** 
Nice to be back on the grind today.  Although it was a busy day and I didn't get the few hours I would have liked (probably got two hours of studying), I'll be back at it again tomorrow and will get my consistency back going forward.

**Link to Work:** 
None



### Day 41: September 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today I'm going to try a strategy to keep different skills building simultaneously and see how I like it.  Namely, I'm going to be working on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course, HackerRank Challenges (Statistics/SQL/Python), Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course, and Udacity's "Intro to Data Analysis" Course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover

**Thoughts:** 
I have spent probably 6 hours staring at this lovely computer screen today on top of a full day of work, so it's time to hang it up.  Overall, really good day of production and studying.  It's NEVER a bad idea to go back to basics and get refreshed on all those statistical concepts, SQL concepts, etc. that have gotten you to where you are today.  I'm going to spend the rest of this week going through this material, and will jump back into Dataquest and the Coursera Google ML course next week.

### Day 42: September 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Today I'm sticking with the same strategy as I did yesterday, although didn't have quite as much time to study.  I did get approximately two hours in.  I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course. Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Admissions Case Study (Simpson's Paradox)
- Problem Set 1 (Understanding Visualizations)
- Probability (Independent and Conditional)
Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Primary-Foreign Key Relationships

**Thoughts:** 
Another productive day working with statistics and SQL.  It's great refreshing some of these concepts that come up again and again in analytics and computer science.  Statistics and probability are great foundational skills to have and are also great for flexing your problem-solving ability.

### Day 43: September 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Again, I stuck with the same strategy as I did yesterday, and got about four hours of studying in.  I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course. Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Conditional Probability, continued
- Bayes Rule
Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Multiple-Table Joins
- Aliases
- Outer Joins

**Thoughts:***
Today was pretty fun and interesting refreshing on conditional probability, Bayes Theorem, and concepts around SQL joints.  Admittedly, I had struggled a little bit in the past with some of these probability concepts, but they seemed quite a bit more digestible today.

### Day 44,45: September 15,16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
Although I have been able to get my coding practice in the last couple days, I haven't had the chance to post due to many "goings on."  Today, I'm getting caught up with my posts and really hope to get back to my normal routine this week.  Again today, I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course, along with a HackerRank challenge.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover.  I also worked on some general problem-solving work around the concept of "MECE" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).  I've included a link to one of the resources as well below.

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

### Day 46: September 17th, 2018

Today's Progress: Getting back into the groove of things today, kicking things off early in the morning with a couple hours of practice.  Again, I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover. I also worked on some general problem-solving work around the concept of "MECE" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). I've included a link to one of the resources as well below.

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

Thoughts: Few hours of progress today, and definitely feeling like it's about time to switch gears and start working on some project work.  I do need to wrap up my Coursera and Dataquest, and then it's time to get much more applied!  And... definitely going to start applying a lot of my knowledge to stuff at work as well.

### Day 47: September 18th, 2018

Today's Progress: Today was a bit lighter of a day, but still got a couple hours of practice in.  Again, I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover. 

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Probability Problem Set 2

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- SQL Subqueries and Temporary Tables

Thoughts: A couple good hours of statistics and SQL today, which just seem to get easier and easier over time.  Although it's hard to feel the progress at times, I know that I'm exponentially more proficient as an analyst as compared to a couple years back.  It definitely motivates me to keep going until I reach my goal of becoming a Data Scientist, and probably beyond that as well (although I wouldn't mind doing a bit more formal education and grabbing a CS degree as well).

### Day 48: September 19th, 2018

Today's Progress: Another day with a couple good hours of coding practice.  Again, I worked on the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover. 

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Estimation (Maximum Likelihood Estimator, Laplace Estimator)

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- SQL Subqueries and Temporary Tables

Thoughts: Concept of Maximum Likelihood Estimator vs Laplace Estimator are really interesting... with the Laplace estimator being the idea that with very small samples, you can actually get a better sense of a probability distribution by adding "fake" data, that is, an observation for every possible outcome, to your sample.  If you haven't read anything about it (and perhaps it doesn't sound too exciting), you should.  I really enjoyed learning about it and seeking to understand its implications.

### Day 49: September 20th, 2018

***Today's Progress***: 
Like Groundhog Day, I kicked things off with more of what I've been doing for the last week or two.  The only course I worked on today is Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below is the link to the course and a couple bullets on what I was able to cover.  I've also included a link to some of the sub-query work I got done (lots o' fun with SQL).

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- SQL Sub-queries and Temporary Tables
- WITH Clause

***Thoughts:*** 
Enjoyed digging into the WITH clause today as a way to neatly arrange your sub-queries.  Since I was exposed to them a number of months back, I've been a big advocate for them and try to utilize in queries at work whenever possible.  Sub-queries in general are immensely helpful and necessary with analyzing data using SQL.  This course is offering some great exposure to those concepts.

### Day 50: September 21st, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Another day starting with the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover. 

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Averages (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Variance

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Data Cleaning (LEFT, RIGHT, STRPOS, POSITION)

***Thoughts:***
50 Days in!!!  Pretty unbelievable. Although I've had to skip 2-3 days while traveling and spending times with friends and family over the course of the challenge, I'm still proud of the accomplishment up to this point. I feel like I've grown a ton by keeping up this practice.  It's extremely gratifying and my confidence increases daily. I will keep some good momentum through the weekend and try to clear some of my coursework from my plate.

### Day 51: September 22nd, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Today my time was a bit limited, so I focused on Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course, and specifically worked on more of the SQL Data Cleaning material.  Link to the course is below, and a link to a few problems and solutions is below as well.

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Data Cleaning (POSITION, CONCAT)

***Thoughts:***
Little bit of a lighter study day today, as I spent most of the day out and about in the sun with my wife, but I plan to get a significant amount of work in tomorrow.  Stay tuned!

### Day 52: September 23rd, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Happy Sunday everyone... got the day started with a few hours of the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover. 

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Variance, Standard Deviation, Standard Score

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- SQL Data Cleaning (CAST, COALESCE)

***Thoughts:***
Some decent progress again today, although this coursework always feels like it takes MUCH longer than I would like.  However, progress is progress.  We've got a friend in town this evening, so it's time to hang this up, but I'll be back to it bright and early tomorrow.

### Day 53: September 24th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Back at it on this fine Monday.. got through the day with a few more hours of the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover.  Fortunately for me, both of these are just... about... DONE!

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Problem Set 3: Estimators 
- Outliers (Quartiles, Trimmed Mean, Percentile)
- Binomial Distribution

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Window Functions (Using OVER, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, NTILE)
- SQL Advanced Joins (FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN)

***Thoughts:***
Another strong day of progress and I'm coming to a conclusion on both of these courses.  I've refreshed a ton of useful information and have really enjoyed all of the brain-teaser type questions surrounding statistics, probability, and SQL.  The coolest thing about it all, is that a year ago, I'm not confident I could have tackled many of these questions.  But through nothing other than continuing to show up, day after day, many of these concepts feel palatable in a way they never have before.

### Day 54: September 25th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Spent the morning wrapping up the SQL for Data Analysis course I've been working on.  See link to course and my thoughts below...

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- SQL Advanced Joins (UNION & UNION ALL, PERFORMANCE TUNING)

***Thoughts:***
This was a REALLY GREAT course covering just about every key topic you need to be an intermediate SQL programmer.  At this point, most of it was a refresh for me, but helped solidify so many things that had up to this point been unclear.  Getting into certain topics like self-joins and performance tuning were really helpful as well.  I'll probably go through this course one more time because it was so good.  I'll be back on the Udacity Statistics course tomorrow, which has also been good.  I can see why Udacity has the great reputation that it does from a teaching standpoint and look forward to engaging further with their curriculum in the future.

### Day 55: September 26th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Spent the morning and some of the evening working on the Udacity Statistics course from the past couple weeks.  See link to course and my thoughts below...

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101
- Central Limit Theorem
-Central Limit Theorem (Programming)
- The Normal Distribution
- Manipulating Normals
- Most Better than Average
- Problem Set 4 (Quartiles, Survey, Random Walk)

***Thoughts:***
Another day of some great progress on Statistics.  This is a pretty long course, but covers tons of valuable material.  Similar to the SQL course I just completed, I can definitely see the value and will likely go through the material one more time to really internalize it.

### Day 56: September 27th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Tackled a number of topics again today, including the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course and Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  I also worked on some general problem-solving work around the concept of "MECE" (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

### Day 58: September 29th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Tackled LOTS OF STATISTICS today with the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course, as well as some of Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

- Regression
- Correlation
- Monte Hall Problem
- Problem Set 6: Regression and Correlation

Udacity SQL for Data Analysis: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud198
- Combination of Topics including Joins and Aggregations

***Thoughts:***
Probably only one day left of this Udacity Statistics course... although admittedly, I kind of have an itch to go through it one more time.  Something I notice again and again in skills absolutely required to master in Data Science interviews are these Statistics and Probability questions.  This is a great course that I think sets you up with the requisite knowledge to speak very intelligently about these topics.

### Day 59: September 30th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Finally finished off the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course today... and learned a ton from this one!  Was good to work through the Final Exam, and although I had to Google a couple formulas, I could understand every concept.  I've become a much stronger statistician with this course, although much of it was a refresher from the college days.  I also worked on some of Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

### Day 60: October 1st, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Started the day with some more SQL for Data Analysis and did kicked off Udacity's "A/B Testing for Business Analysts" course.  I will try to get a little bit more work in over the course of the day, but I'm also headed to the Broncos-Chiefs Monday Night Football game.  I'm definitely not mad at a night off after all of the hard work I've put in recently.

### Day 61: October 3rd, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Although I was able to get my studying in yesterday, I didn't have a chance to post, so I'm not including it toward my 100 Day Challenge.  Started today with some of the Udacity "Intro to Statistics" course, as I want to revisit some of the concepts one more time this week in order to solidify them.  I also worked on some of Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course. Lastly, I worked through some HackerRank challenges on the topics I'm reinforcing including probability, statistics, and SQL.  Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:

Udacity Intro to Statistics: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/st101

### Day 63: October 5th, 2018

***Today's Progress***:
Getting close to being through my second iteration of this recent coursework, including SQL and Statistics. Specifically, covered some of the Udacity's "Intro to Statistics" and "SQL for Data Analysis" courses. Below are the links to each and some bullets on what I was able to cover:
